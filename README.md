# Dictionary

Being the students in the Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP, INT2204 - 25) class at UET-VNU, we formed a team
to complete  this  project as **our major assignment**.

This is a basic dictionary app, written in Java,
strongly **conforming to the Object-Oriented Programming
paradigm and techniques** that the Java Programming
Language has to offer, or enforces.

## Introduction

This is a dictionary app with basic features:

`(TODO: Write the features here)`

`(TODO: Embed sample/demo images of the GUI here)`

The app presents two interfaces to the user:
1. The CLI (Command Line Interface): The user can run
the JAR file in the command line to use the features
mentioned above.
2. The GUI (Graphical User Interface): The JAR file
can be run directly, and a window with familiar
graphical controls (such as dialogs, buttons, text
boxes...) will be displayed to the user.
