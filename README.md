Being the students in the Object-Oriented Programming
(OOP, INT2204 - 25) class at UET-VNU, we formed a team
to complete  this  project as **our major assignment**.

This is a basic dictionary app, written in Java,
strongly **conforming to the Object-Oriented Programming
paradigm and techniques** that the Java Programming
Language has to offer, or enforces.
